description: Test harness for executing Speckit workflows non-interactively using subagents. Use when you need to test the complete Speckit pipeline (Phase 0 → Phase 3) or individual phases, validate artifact generation across all commands, automate testing of specification-to-implementation workflows, or verify cross-phase consistency. This skill orchestrates the execution of all Speckit commands in order without user intervention.

# GitHub Speckit Tester

A comprehensive test harness for validating the Speckit workflow system by executing all phases non-interactively using subagents. After each phase clear the context using /clear

## Overview

This skill provides automated testing capabilities for the complete Speckit pipeline, executing all commands in sequence from specification to implementation without requiring user interaction.

## Test Scenario
Please read the following file to load the test scenario:
#file: github/test-scenarios/${input:scenario}


## Core Concepts

### Non-Interactive Execution

All Speckit commands must be executed without user intervention:
- Automatic decision-making for clarifications
- Default selections for ambiguous choices
- Automated validation and progression through phases
- Error handling and recovery without user input

### Subagent Orchestration

The test harness uses subagents to:
- Execute each phase independently
- Isolate phase execution for better debugging
- Parallelize independent phases when possible
- Maintain clean execution context per phase

Document start time and end time, totals execution time, and tokens consumed inclusive of all subagents

### Execution Workflow

| Step | Command | Description | Output |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1    | Prerequisites           | Validate environment and credentials by running `.specify/scripts/bash/validate-env.sh` | Validation confirmation    |
| 2 | `/speckit.specify` | Create feature specification | `spec.md` |
| 3 | `/speckit.clarify` | Resolve ambiguities | Updated `spec.md` |
| 4 | `/speckit.plan` | Design technical architecture | `plan.md`, `data-model.md` |
| 5 | Run `/review.tf-design` prompt | Review and approve design | Approval confirmation |
| 6 | `/speckit.tasks` | Generate implementation tasks | `tasks.md` |
| 7 | `/speckit.implement` | Generate Terraform code and test deployment in sandbox workspace | `.tf` files |
| 8 | Deploy | Deploy to HCP Terraform | Workspace created |
| 9 | Run `/report.tf-deployment` prompt | Generate comprehensive deployment report
| 10 | Cleanup | Queue destroy plan | Resources cleaned |
